Wetaher App React Rebuild
Remake the weather app using its API in React

Peer Review: Current weather data is correctly displayed, with 3 additional time increments. The time for those however all say 8am. The search function also works and data is rerenders correctly. There is also responsiveness.  The five day forecast however don't work nor the favorites, however I like the fact that you can click on the day and it opens up to see more data of the weather that day! - Halley Pham
